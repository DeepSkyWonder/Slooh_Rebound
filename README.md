# Slooh_Rebound
Code for Slooh Rebound Quest Project

### Added 'Inner Solar System plus Eccentric Planet' Simulation

Location:

Slooh_Rebound/jupyter_notebooks/rebound_inner_solar_system_plus_eccentric.ipynb

Updates:

>1. Added simulation snapshots, so simulation starts faster on secnod run.
>2. Made all paths relative to notebook path, so simulation can be run from local repository copy.
>3. Updated date format in animation to "YYYY, DD 'Abreviated Month Format'".
>4. Moved files to github repository 'Slooh_Rebound'

>Todo: Need to move temp. directory for simulation frames, so these are not uploaded to github
